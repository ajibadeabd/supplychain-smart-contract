<!-- # Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><h2>SupplyChain Smart Contract</h2><p>This smart contract is designed to facilitate a supply chain system on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation of products, transfer of ownership, and addition of events related to the products. The contract also includes administrative controls to manage participants and their roles.</p><h3>Contract Overview</h3><p>The <code>SupplyChain</code> contract consists of the following main components:</p><h4>Structs</h4><ol><li><p><code>Event</code>: Represents an event associated with a product. It includes the event type, timestamp, location, and the address of the participant who added the event.</p></li><li><p><code>Product</code>: Represents a product in the supply chain. It contains information such as the product name, description, unique product ID, current owner, status, location, timestamp, and the number of events associated with the product.</p></li></ol><h4>Mappings</h4><ol><li><p><code>events</code>: Maps product IDs to an array of events associated with each product.</p></li><li><p><code>products</code>: Maps product IDs to their respective Product struct.</p></li><li><p><code>isAdmin</code>: Maps addresses to a boolean value indicating whether the address is an admin.</p></li><li><p><code>isParticipant</code>: Maps addresses to a boolean value indicating whether the address is a participant.</p></li></ol><h4>Events</h4><p>The contract emits the following events:</p><ol><li><p><code>ProductCreated(uint256 productId, string name, string description)</code>: Triggered when a new product is created. It includes the product ID, name, and description.</p></li><li><p><code>ProductTransferred(uint256 productId, address previousOwner, address newOwner, string status, string location)</code>: Triggered when the ownership of a product is transferred. It includes the product ID, previous owner address, new owner address, status, and location.</p></li><li><p><code>EventAdded(uint256 productId, string eventType, uint256 timestamp, string location, address participant)</code>: Triggered when a new event is added to a product. It includes the product ID, event type, timestamp, location, and the address of the participant who added the event.</p></li></ol><h3>Modifiers</h3><ol><li><p><code>onlyAdmin()</code>: Requires that the caller of a function is an admin.</p></li><li><p><code>onlyParticipant()</code>: Requires that the caller of a function is a participant.</p></li></ol><h3>Functions</h3><ol><li><p><code>addParticipant(address _participant)</code>: Allows an admin to add a participant to the supply chain system.</p></li><li><p><code>getParticipant(address _participant)</code>: Allows an admin to check if an address is a participant.</p></li><li><p><code>createProduct(string memory _name, string memory _description)</code>: Allows an admin to create a new product in the supply chain system.</p></li><li><p><code>transferOwnership(uint256 _productId, address _newOwner, string memory _status, string memory _location)</code>: Allows a participant to transfer ownership of a product to another participant.</p></li><li><p><code>addEvent(uint256 _productId, string memory _eventType, string memory _location)</code>: Allows a participant to add an event to a product.</p></li><li><p><code>getProduct(uint256 _productId)</code>: Retrieves information about a product based on its ID.</p></li><li><p><code>getProductEvent(uint256 productId, uint256 eventId)</code>: Retrieves a specific event associated with a product.</p></li><li><p><code>getProductEvents(uint256 productId)</code>: Retrieves all events associated with a product.</p></li></ol><p>Note: The contract includes various access control modifiers to ensure that only admins or participants can perform specific actions.</p><p>Please refer to the solidity code for further details on the implementation of each function and additional comments.</p></div>
